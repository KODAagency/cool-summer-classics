Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” marked the beginning of grunge, slap bracelets were stylin’ (but bling bling was better) and only dweebs didn’t think Beavis & Butthead were fly. You busted the Macarena moves, lip-synced to the Spice Girls and Back Street Boys and said “yadda yadda yadda” to the Y2K panic that never happened.
